# Recruitment Funnel Analytics (Simulated Data)

This project generates a synthetic dataset of 2,500 job applicants moving through a recruitment funnel (Application → Screening → Interview → Offer → Hired).

- **Script**: `R/01_simulate_funnel.R`  
- **Dataset**: `data/simulated_funnel_data.csv`  

### Purpose
To provide a clean, realistic dataset for practicing recruitment funnel analysis, including:
- Funnel drop-off rates
- Recruiter performance differences
- Source quality comparisons
- Impact of candidate test scores on outcomes

### How to use
1. Run `R/01_simulate_funnel.R` to regenerate the dataset.  
2. Or use the already generated dataset in `data/simulated_funnel_data.csv`.
